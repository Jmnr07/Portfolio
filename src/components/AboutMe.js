                Hello! I'm JM Reasonda.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                California-based self-taught Front-End-Developer, pursuing his
                dream to be a Full-Stack Software Engineer.
                <br />
                I love solving complex problems. I grew up having puzzles as my toys
                and I'm pretty patient about it.
                <br />
                I love doing adventures and doing a lot of 
                activities like AcroYoga, Hiking, Tennis and more.    
                <br />
            </p>
